	<h1>Sculptural Qualities</h1>
	<p>
	The changes in Hellenistic and Classical sculpting are very subtle and complex, both are known for their depictions of human anatomy in sculpting. Obviously, with the classical era as precursor anatomy is really the main focus, it doesn't dive into too much emotional detail or storytelling. The transition to the Hellenistic period came with the death of Alexander the Great. 
</p>
<p>
	The dramatic change in styles came to be because on Alexander’s conquests Greeks became exposed to many Asian cultures and Alexander the great saught to incorporate different cultures into Ancient Greek culture changing the art and way people thought. Instead of assimilating to greek culture. Hellenistic Art has a bigger emphasis on emotion and storytelling, they elaborated on poses and expression while still using the detailed anatomy the classical style is known for. 
	The Kritios Boy is a great example of classical Greek sculpture anatomy. The artist who created the piece has an amazing understanding of anatomy, he grasps the concept well that different parts of the body function in a systematic way. You can see the counteracting of his muscles in the contrapposto stance his spine clearly makes an ‘S’ shape. The Kritios Boy was a precursor to the later classical depictions of athletes in sculpture. Making it a very innovative sculpture of the time. Especially with its life-like accuracy, the relaxed skeletal figure has a naturally expanded rib cage suggesting The Kritios boy is in the act of breathing. 
	During the Hellenistic period, we see a large shift. Artists start to be concerned with the accuracy of their depictions, not just the physical anatomy but also the emotional expression as well. The subject of the work came to be a lot more of a variety. People were starting to sculpt depictions of more common people and things. They found a lot of value and depth in the everyday lives of individuals. It possessed a political and emotional meaning that hadn’t been done as clearly.

The Galatian Suicide is an amazing example of this emotion, that has been beautifully preserved. The face of the man is in exact Hellenistic proportions though ethnically it seems the man is Gallic, his muscles are tightened as he is piercing the sword through his chest maintaining that extreme anatomical accuracy. The woman he is supporting on his right side is more modestly covered and exhibits a lot of body language suggesting she’s lifeless. Her limp body doesn’t have any tension in the muscles as her legs lay on the ground.
</p>
<p>
The intrinsic meaning is inherently political depicting the hardships of wartime and the casualty of war. At the time of its creation, the Romans and Gauls were at war. It is believed that the man killed his wife and then himself to prevent capture. If I were to have one of these to take home it would be The Galatian Suicidee though it’s a lot more interesting to me and has a lot more going on too look at. It would be interesting trying to fit in my studio apartment.
