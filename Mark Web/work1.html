	<h1>San Francisco: How did it get like this?</h1>
	<p>Conversations</p>

The early to mid sixties a time of economic prosperity and war efforts. A time the traditionalist generation remembers fondly. While the US was fondly remebered as stable at the time people were uneasy, divorce and murder rates were skyrocketing. We were on the brink of an environmental crisis, yet politicians were still calling Rachel Carson a communist for writing Silent Spring. The US was willfully ignorant, submissive and the oppressed were fearful to exercise a desire for what was rightfully theirs. With the start of the civil rights movement more groups educated themselves and found things oppressive. Civil rights was a catalyst for a complete reconstruction of the social environment, Kennedy’s administration began to look at workplace discrimination against women. Women's contraceptives were becoming more socially acceptable. Times were changing, the youth felt mis represented and ignored, even scared.

		The Vietnam war was becoming increasingly unpopular among the young men of this nation. As the number of them being drafted went up, so was the number of them being sent home in coffins. In the year 1968 our military presence peaked at 540,000 troops in Vietnam that same year 16,899 were confirmed killed in action. These young oppressed men and women felt a lack of inspiration and were wanting to find out things themselves. They were going against parental authority by dressing different, growing longer hair, and listening to new music. The teenager was born. Many of them were running away from home and dropping out to go to the source. Find the home of their new found counter culture. Famed by Kerouac and the Beat generation San Francisco was seen as a cheap place to live and a creative environment.

		A whole new generation of writers and artists were emerging in the area at the time. Ken Kesey a writing student at Stanford had found great success after his first book One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1959) was published. Later Kesey revealed that he had taken part in the LSD experiments at Stanford. Having the influence and popularity he did with the youth it made people want to try LSD, they wanted the Kesey experience. Kesey and his gang of Merry Pranksters are credited with starting the San Francisco counter culture movement. After his Tour of Disruption the Further Bus’s main voyage. Kesey became very spiritual when he went on trips on LSD he felt that under the influence of LSD people would see a larger truth. Kesey and The Merry Pranksters wanted as many people as possible to take LSD, a massive communal trip. This is how the Acid Tests were born. They rented concert halls and invited a friend’s band The Warlocks to play. Later on the band would change their name to The Grateful Dead and go on to be one of the most influential psychedelic rock bands in history, and the acid tests even though legal were seen as a monumental change in the culture of San Francisco as a city still seen today.

		he news of what was going on in San Francisco traveled fast and the Hippies and Artist flocked to the rundown and affordable Haight neighborhood of San Francisco. It was cheap to live and people helped each other out. At the time the neighborhood was not very trendy like it is now, crime was frequent and wild dogs roamed the area.
’’It used to be that you couldn’t afford to live anywhere else in the Bay Area except San Francisco, now look at the place” - Michael Russo a San Francisco Native.

The hippies changed the neighborhood to an idealistic loving place. They created a free clothing store, a self proclaimed “psychedelic shop” it became the home to many artists and musicians. Many of whom became renowned and still influence artists today. Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix and Creedence Clearwater revival were just a few bands and artists who produced world renowned records during this time. 
As the artists got more famous the more of them left. Kesey was long gone, to his commune in Oregon. Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix had passed. The Grateful Dead were a touring world phenomenon at this point. Yet it seemed like the neighborhood it started in was forgotten.  I wondered why? I’ve lived here for three years and though I knew my classic rock history it was hard to visualize it all going down on this street. I headed there to try and get a better picture for myself.

 The chill spot in a tough city- Haight and Ashbury, on a typical summer day it’s sidewalks are crowded with shopping tourists and transplants. A constant buzz of street music and road construction fill the air with noise. The rare bay area summer sun illuminates the colorful murals that cover the neighborhood, and it’s pastel victorians. On the surface the legendary San Francisco neighborhood looks to be what’s expected. Charming and mellow, but things have definitely changed. The rent in this area used to cost less than two hundred a month, now it’s considered luck to find one under two thousand. 
As I walk aimlessly around pointing my DSLR at whatever interests me, today it’s strung out vagrant missing teeth and selling LSD.  I bobbed and weaved under the beaded curtains and low hanging tapestries, I'm finding myself getting distracted by the psychedelic color scheme of everything. Almost tripping over a street musician I find myself at the first place I plan to visit, the oldest owned and operated store on Haight street: Pipe Dreams a shop that specializes in accessories for cannabis and tobacco. The shop isn’t typical but it is expected. I figured If you’ve been open on haight for this long you’re bound to have some sort of personality. It has everything from crazy costume apparel, hats, rings and jewelry to smoking accessories. Loud Jimi Hendrix is playing and it smells like incense. At the counter I met Chris Swanson who was standing in front of a large poster of Bob Dylan. He is the acting manager and son of the owner, I figured to ask a few questions about the business.

	<p>
		Mark O’Dell: So how long have you guys been in business? 
Chris Swanson: Since nineteen sixty three. 
O’Dell: So were the cops ever concerned before cannabis was legal or decriminalized?  
Swanson: *Laughs* no my friend back during that time the shop hadn’t been expanded the space to what it is now. This was a small specialized cigarette and tobacco shop back then my grandparents; immigrants during the sixties this was one of the only neighborhoods here they could afford to start a business and live in. We didn't start selling all that stuff *Points at a literal wall of bongs* until the tourists came and wanted to see the hippies and stuff. 
O’Dell: You know if your grandparents liked the hippies?
Swanson: *Laughs* no well they certainly did not agree with them, they’re both very hardworking and conservative. They did hire a few back in the day to work the register and I never heard anything negative. My grandpa said they’d do plenty of work for you. 
O’Dell: That’s interesting considering the stereotype that they’re lazy. 
Swanson: Yes I think so, things get blown out of proportion with time. 
</p>

	I thanked swanson for his short interview and was on my way to the next to destination Zam Zam a Haight street drinking institution since nineteen forty one, I had never been myself but heard that it was a no nonsense place the old locals went. The sun was setting and it’s light peaking through golden gate park, dimming the whole neighborhood to a golden glow. Spectacular. As I gripped the front door of Zam Zam I figured it was a good place to meet someone with a real take on what went on here I wanted to  find out where and when the neighborhood took its turn not for worse, just different. The Room was dark and the walls were eclectic. Covered in album art, old photographs of the city, weapons and vintage alcohol ads. The room wreaked like my grandpa’s Dunhills. Midnight Rider played on the jukebox. I was there for sometime, after a drink at the rustic old bar shaped like a horse shoe I met exactly who I was hoping I would. An elderly woman wearing purple and green who went by the name of Delaney Yong. It felt strange to put someone I just met on the spot until she told me how long she’d been living in the haight.

Mark O’Dell: So Mrs. Young You were born in the haight spring of nineteen fifty that’s correct?
Delany Yong: Yes that would be correct. 
O’Dell: So when did you see a rapid change in the neighborhood from the counterculture of the sixties to what it is now? 
Yong: Well this whole city has always been changing, they didn’t all get up and leave and say screw it! I think people grew up a little bit, a lot of the really dedicated people left the city. A lot my friends ended up all over california in communes around the santa cruz mountains and areas like that free and beautiful. 
O’Dell: Why did they leave?
Yong: Well everyone wanted to see what we were doing here.. Like they lead you to believe we didn't think we were changing the world, we wanted to be free. So once the tour buses came around to examine “The movement” as they called it people felt like animals and they ran! Ran! Ran!
O’Dell: You didn’t have a desire to leave as well?
Yong: Well I’d grew up here, met my husband on Haight when I was young and working at a hair salon that’s used to be where that Ice cream shop is now. My parents lived here and loved us both very much, I guess we just got old and had kids. *laughs* 
O’Dell: Do you think certain ideas and things of the hippie movement were over exaggerated? 
Yong: Well certainly yes! Women were certainly not as loose as everyone says they were. Plenty of our friends had steady relationships, a lot of good old boys and girls from the midwest came out here wanting to see what all the fuss was about. A lot of us were still religous didn't have sex until we were married.  
O’Dell: Is the counterculture still alive today? 
Yong: I think it always will be, but that meaning can change just like all the change we've been talking about at this bar for the past half hour. Luckily I think we’ve gotten more and more progressive. You don’t need to have such a big movement for that cause anymore because most people accept love these days. 
	I left Zam Zam feeling perplexed that night. It was clear to me that this neighborhood and the people who made it famous changed it forever. People change too though, it will forever be known for this movement but at some point counterculture just becomes culture.
