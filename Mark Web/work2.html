	<h1>Controversy is Art</h1>
	<p>Essay</p>

<p>
	Is it really even art if somebody isn't getting angry about it? In all seriousness rather than being controversial for the sake of being controversial, when massive change happens especially in the art world people react quite often to excess, but that's what people do when massive change challenges their values and education. Manet was a revolutionary painter who changed the way style was perceived and was no stranger to controversy. Manet’s controversy didn't come from his change in style or aesthetic. Manet influenced modern painting by depicting modern, everyday life. He also shied away from the regular three-dimensional painting of the rennaisance. Manet depicted his figures flat which he likely derived from the technique of Japanese artists.

		The real controversy of Manet lays in the expression of the woman. A painting that wasn't displayed until two years after its completion. The woman at hand in the photo was a sex worker which people had a small problem with the word Olympia was directly associated with sex workers in Paris in the 1860s. It wasn’t the stark nudity, nude works of art were actually very popular in France at the time. The woman had a casual expression on her face. Her making light of sexual intimacy was what sparked controversy. It explores not just the nude, also the power it has on people.  Manet’s works may have been controversial but he’s more known for his transformation of style, people got angry but with style, they were inspired.

	Manet made regular life sublime for some people. A lot of fantasizing was present in art before his time, it was about the unattainable and works of fiction. People related more to Manet’s works because he was speaking for the everyday working-class Parisian. His paintings weren’t an escape quite the opposite his paintings were a reality check.
